# odin-ruby-connect-four
## The Odin Project - Ruby Project: Connect Four

Build a simple connect four game that runs in the command line using TDD.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Ruby
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github
 - RSpec

## What I learned:
 - Better understanding of test driven development
 - How to create tests using RSpec
 
## Still can improve:
 - Need to get more comfortable with writing tests before any code
 - I think my tests could probably be cleaner and the format more consistent
 - Need to consider if any methods should be private
 - Could add more functionality (start new game, save game, etc.)
 - Could make it better visually in the command line
